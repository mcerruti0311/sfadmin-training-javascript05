JavaScript training hour 5

### What You’ll Learn in This Hour:

* The numeric and string data types supported by JavaScript
* Conversion between data types
* How to manipulate strings

### Numbers and Strings
We use the term data type to talk about the nature of the data that a variable contains. A string variable contains a string, a number variable, a numerical value, and so forth. However, the JavaScript language is what’s called a loosely typed language, meaning that JavaScript variables can be interpreted as different data types in differing circumstances.

In JavaScript, you don’t have to declare the data type of a variable before using it, as the JavaScript interpreter will make its best guess. If you put a string into your variable and later want to interpret that value as a number, that’s OK with JavaScript, provided that the variable actually contains a string that’s “like” a numerical value (for example, “200px” or “50 cents”, but not something such as your name). Later you can use it as a string again, if you want.

In this hour you learn about the JavaScript data types of number, string, and Boolean, and about some built-in methods for handling values of these types. We also mention escape sequences in strings, and two special JavaScript data types—null and undefined.

### Exercises

* Write a JavaScript function to remove a given number of characters from the end of a string.
* Write a JavaScript function to capitalize the first letter of each word in a given string.
